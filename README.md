# Learning Web3 🚀

Welcome to my **Web3 learning journey**!  

This repository documents my step-by-step learning and experimentation with blockchain, smart contracts, oracles, and decentralized applications (dApps).  
The goal is to **build a solid foundation** in Web3 while tracking my progress publicly.
